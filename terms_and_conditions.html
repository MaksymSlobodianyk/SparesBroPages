      <h1>Terms and Conditions for SparesBro</h1>
      <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 15.11.2025</p>

      <p>
        Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions")
        carefully before using the SparesBro mobile application (the "Service")
        operated by Maksym Slobodianyk ("us", "we", or "our").
      </p>

      <h2>Provider Information</h2>

      <p>The Service is operated by:</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Name:</strong> Maksym Slobodianyk<br />
        <strong>Registered Seat:</strong><br />
        <strong>ID No. (IČO):</strong><br />
        <strong>Registration:</strong> Registered in the Trade Register
        (Živnostenský rejstřík) kept by the appropriate Trade Licensing Office.
      </p>

      <hr class="divider" />

      <p>
        Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance
        of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors,
        users, and others who access or use the Service.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >By downloading, installing, or using the Service, you agree to be
          bound by these Terms.</strong
        >
        If you disagree with any part of the terms, you may not access the
        Service.
      </p>

      <h2>1. The Service</h2>

      <p>
        SparesBro provides a tool to help users track and manage consumable
        items that require regular replacement. The Service allows you to log
        items, track stock levels, set replacement schedules (time-based or
        usage-based), and receive reminders.
      </p>

      <p>The Service is offered in two versions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Essential Version:</strong> A free version that allows you to
          track a limited number of items (one item).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unlimited Version:</strong> A paid version, unlocked via a
          one-time in-app purchase, which allows you to track unlimited items
          and enables data synchronization via Apple's iCloud service.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. In-App Purchase</h2>

      <p>
        The "Unlimited Version" is an optional upgrade available as a one-time
        in-app purchase.
      </p>

      <p>
        All payments are processed through the Apple App Store, from which you
        originally downloaded the application. You agree to comply with all
        terms and conditions of the App Store. All purchases are final and
        non-refundable. Any refund requests or issues with payment must be
        directed to Apple, as we do not manage the transaction or have the
        ability to process refunds.
      </p>

      <h2>3. User-Generated Content (Your Data)</h2>

      <p>
        You are solely responsible for all data, information, item names,
        history logs, stock counts, and other content ("User Content") that you
        create or input into the Service.
      </p>

      <p>
        You retain all ownership rights to your User Content. You grant us a
        limited, non-exclusive license solely to host, store, and display your
        User Content on your device (and in your personal iCloud account, if you
        purchase the Unlimited Version) for the sole purpose of providing the
        Service's functionality to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are not responsible for the loss, corruption, or accuracy of your
        User Content. You are responsible for maintaining your own backups.
      </p>

      <h2>4. iCloud Synchronization</h2>

      <p>
        The "Unlimited Version" of the Service offers an optional feature to
        synchronize your User Content across your Apple devices using Apple's
        iCloud service.
      </p>

      <p>
        This feature is provided "as is" and "as available." Your use of iCloud
        is subject to Apple's terms of service. We are not responsible for any
        data loss, synchronization errors, service interruptions, or other
        issues related to iCloud.
      </p>

      <h2>5. License and Restrictions</h2>

      <p>
        We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable
        license to use the Service on any Apple-branded product that you own or
        control, as permitted by the Apple App Store Terms of Service.
      </p>

      <p>You agree not to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Service.</li>
        <li>Copy, modify, or create derivative works based on the Service.</li>
        <li>Rent, lease, lend, sell, or sublicense the Service.</li>
        <li>Use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Disclaimers and No Warranty</h2>

      <p>
        The Service is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE," without any
        warranties of any kind, express or implied.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> The Service is an informational tool only.
        We do not warrant that the Service will be error-free, uninterrupted, or
        that its reminders will be 100% accurate or timely. You are solely
        responsible for remembering to replace your items. You should not rely
        solely on the Service's reminders for critical, safety-related, or
        high-value items (e.g., medical supplies, car parts, or safety
        equipment).
      </p>

      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all liability for
        any damages or losses (including property damage, personal injury, or
        financial loss) resulting from a missed, late, or incorrect replacement,
        regardless of whether a reminder failed to function correctly.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>

      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall Maksym
        Slobodianyk, nor our affiliates, partners, or employees, be liable for
        any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,
        including without limitation, loss of data, loss of profits, or other
        intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of, or inability
        to access or use, the Service.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our total liability to you for all claims arising from or related to the
        Service is limited to the amount you paid for the one-time in-app
        purchase to unlock the "Unlimited Version".
      </p>

        This information is used solely to identify bugs, improve usability, and
        enhance the Service's features. We take measures to configure these

        names or history logs), but you acknowledge that anonymous usage data
        will be collected.

        Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Termination</h2>

      <p>
        We may terminate or suspend your license to use the Service immediately,
        without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including

        You may terminate these Terms at any time by deleting the Service from
        your device.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>

      <p>
        These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws
        of the Czech Republic, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
        Any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be
        submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in the
        Czech Republic.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>

      <p>
        We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these
        Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least
        30 days' notice (e.g., via an in-app notification) before new terms take
        effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our
        sole discretion.
      </p>

      <p>
        By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become
        effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
